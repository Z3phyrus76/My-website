## Notable Projects

### For Her
This interactive page was **cloned and adapted** from [OlieWu's repository](https://github.com/OlieWu/tinawina) to showcase personalization and layout integration. All credit for the original design goes to OlieWu.

### Spin the Wheel
A fully customizable spinner built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas — categories, colors, and outcome are user-controlled with visual effects like confetti.
